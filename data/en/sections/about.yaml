# a summary about you
summary: "I have spent over four years working in Data Science, evolving into a role that bridges <b>data strategy, AI-driven automation and digital transformation</b>. My journey has taken me across industries, from luxury goods to biotechnology, from pure software development to <b>data operations and AI integration</b>, helping businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.<br>  
What I love about Data Science is the constant opportunity to ask <b>why</b> and find clear, actionable answers through data. Whether it's optimizing processes, building AI-powered tools or structuring large-scale data platforms, I enjoy transforming complexity into meaningful insights.<br><br>  
I am fond of <b>open-source projects & communities</b> like Hugging Face, Stack Overflow and Kaggle, as I believe they have made programming and AI more accessible. I advocate for fostering <b>innovation through shared knowledge</b>, which empowers individuals to separate real insights from misinformation and leverage data responsibly.<br>  
I am particularly interested in how emerging technologies like <b>AI, cloud computing and decentralized systems</b> are reshaping industries. A key focus of mine is ensuring these advancements remain <b>fair, ethical, and sustainable</b> while being accessible to a wider audience.<br><br>  
Outside work, I enjoy playing and watching footballâ€”not just for the game itself, but for how it brings people together, even if just for a short moment.<br><br>"
