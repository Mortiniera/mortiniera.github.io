- name: Transformer implementation for Sequence to Sequence translation
  logo: images/sections/projects/nlp.png
  #role: Author
  timeline: "March 2024 - Present"
  repo: https://github.com/Mortiniera/transformers-implementation/
  #url: https://medium.com/@thevie/fighting-telco-customer-churn-problem-a-data-driven-analysis-e7c61cfae0dd
  summary: From scratch Pytorch implementation of the original transformer paper. Briefly explain how it works through a sentence-to-sentence translation task example with English to Spanish.

- name: Algorithmic trading using MACD
  logo: images/sections/projects/stock-market.jpeg
  #role: Author
  timeline: "Jan 2024"
  repo: https://github.com/Mortiniera/algorithmic-trading-technical-indicators
  # url: ""
  summary: Comprehensive and educational analysis of investment strategies using the performance metrics of GAFAM stocks ðŸ“ˆ - Google, Apple, Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, and Microsoft.<br>It evaluates two distinct approaches. An *active strategy utilizing Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)* for trading signals and a *passive strategy employing dollar-cost averaging (DCA)* with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as a benchmark.

- name: Collaborative Image Inpainting
  logo: images/sections/projects/gan.jpeg
  #role: Author
  timeline: "Sep 2020 - Dec 2020"
  repo: https://github.com/Mortiniera/collaborative-image-inpainting
  # url: ""
  summary: Restore images with centrally masked areas using generative models to accurately predict and reconstruct missing parts.<br>Post-GAN training, the discriminator and generator collaboratively produce high-quality image samples using continuous gradient-based updates to the activation maps until the samples are classified as real by the discriminator.

- name: Taught an agent to land on the moon using Reinforcement learning
  logo: images/sections/projects/reinforcement-learning.png
  #role: Author
  timeline: "Oct 2019"
  #repo: https://github.com/Mortiniera/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Data%20Analysis%20Series/Fighting%20_Churn/Telco_Customer_Retention.ipynb
  url: https://github.com/Mortiniera/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20Series/OpenAI/Lunar_Lander.ipynb
  summary: Developed a Python-based reinforcement learning agent capable of mastering the Lunar Lander game from OpenAI Gym. <br>I implemented the **REINFORCE loss function** using categorical cross-entropy weighted by the discounted reward for each observation and balanced the need for exploration (to learn diverse strategies) with exploitation (maximizing reward outcomes).
